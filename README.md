# Visual Studio Code *njsproj* Extension

This will helps the teams which are uses both Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio.

## Features

**Focus on your work, this is a silent extension.**<br/><br/>
This extension works like Visual Studio itself. There is **no need** configuration or manually adding files to .njsproj with context menu or confirm box.
It keeps your .njsproj files sync while you are adding or removing files/folders from your project.

* Supports drag and drop multiple files/folders from outside of workspace
* Supports nested folders deletion or move in workspace
